## VTS Coding Test by Andy Weeks
Angular CLI and Typescript

Non-vanilla libraries:
• angular-in-web-memeory-api
• ag-grid
• lodash

## Known Issues
With reassign, there is some oddity when you select clear to reset the selections. The camera selection grid seems to need you to click clear twice before it's active again and I can't see a logical reason for this at the moment.

## Future Thoughts
In the comments there are some future notes for bulk actions, like bulk unassign and bulk reassign.
I'm also sure the methods for getting data out of the API and joining it are not as efficient as they could be, but they get the job done for right now.
Additionally, I feel like there's a more efficient way to handle all the services, but again, it gets the job done for the moment. Work first, optimize later.
